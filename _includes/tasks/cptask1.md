#### Do you understand Philosophy?

- **Description:**

The first task is relatively simple for students. you just need to show you have understanding of philosophy.
 Read through the following paragraph and propose your thoughts/words about it.

"I will note that mind differs importantly from body in that body is by it's nature divisible,
 while mind is indivisible when I think about my mind or in other words Myself in so far,
I am just a thinking being .I can't distinguish any parts.I understand myself to be a whole
unified thing although my whole mind seems united to my whole body.I know cutting off a foot or an
arm, would not take anything away from my mind and the abilities to will,sense and understand can't
be called parts that it is one and the same mind that wills,senses and understands on the other hand
whenever I think of a physical or extended thing, I can mentally divide it
and therefore understand that Object is divisible. the single fact would be enough to
teach me that my mind and my body are distinct."

What do you think of this argument by Rene Descartes?
Why does he claim that his mind is indivisible, Can someone not just cut your mind in two halves?

**This task is about Philosophy but it's not all we do here we go ahead and formalize the argument.**
