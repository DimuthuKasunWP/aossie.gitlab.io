#### Migrate Code of Carbon Calulators to a different page


- **Description:**

Currently, the calculators of CO2 emission from airplanes and calculator of CO2 absorption from trees are present in know More section of extension. The know more section is not an intuitive place for these calculators, we expect users to create a new HTML page "calculators.html" and migrate all code related to calculators from "knowMore.html" to calculators.html. This page will be linked to extension in future tasks, and candidate is only required to migrate the code into separate file and not worry about its integration with extension.
