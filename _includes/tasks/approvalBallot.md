#### Implement Approval ballot


- **Description:**

The Approval Ballot will be used in the future by the Approval voting method. All other ballot types already exist except it. You will need to create this ballot representation on the frontend and a parser at the backend. For guidance, you can look how the other ballot representations have been created on the frontend and how their corresponding parsers are created on the backend.
