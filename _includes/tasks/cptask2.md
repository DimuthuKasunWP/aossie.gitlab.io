#### Formalizing the argument.

- **Description**
In the second task we would like to see if you can formalize a simple argument by yourself. You can choose any simple
argument you like and formalize it using Isabelle but any work you upload should be of your own and not copied form anywhere
in the internet. also please add a link to the place from where you take someone's argument or a text.

hint: for the argument in the task1 file you can see- https://github.com/Manikaran20/Isabelle/blob/master/Rene_descartes.thy
