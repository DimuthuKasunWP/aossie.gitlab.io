#### Migrate Code of Air Quality Index to a different page


- **Description:**

Currently, the section of Air Quality Index is present in know More section of extension. The know more section is not an intuitive place for Air Quality index, we expect users to create a new HTML page "airQualityIndex.html" and migrate all code related to air Quality Index from "knowMore.html" to airQualityIndex.html. This page will be linked to extension in future tasks, and candidate is only required to migrate the code into separate file and not worry about its integration with extension.
