#### Redesigning Mind The Word Extension


- **Description:**

Mind The Word is a Language Immersion tool for Chrome, that is very effective for learning new languages. But as it has been designed by developers, the user experience lacks in some areas. <br>
For instance, the landing page is the option to change language setting and translator service.
This is not important for a regular user, who has already selected a language and service.<br>
Another instance, there is an entire tab for back-up and restoring settings, when simple buttons can do.<br>
The task is to recommend design changes to MTW, keeping users in mind.
It would involve talking to the users of the extension, taking their feedback and providing design recommendations.<br>
*We do not expect the candidate to write the code.*
