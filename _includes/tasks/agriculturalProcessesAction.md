#### Support queries regarding emissions caused due to different Agricultural processes


- **Description:**

CarbonFootprint Action  is a Google Assistant Action that supports several categories of emission queries like appliances, travel and many more. It obtains this data from the CarbonFootprint-API, a REST API which serves these requests. The CarbonFootprint-API recently added support for new category: 'Emissions caused due to different agricultural processes'. The goal of this task is to add support for 'agricultural processes' category into the CarbonFootprint Action.

- **Requirements:**
  - Gitlab account and knowledge about Git.
  - Knowledge about how to use REST API and how it works.
  - Familiarity with Node.js
  - Familiarity with Google Assistant and what 'Actions on Google' is.
  - Knowledge about DialogFlow is a plus!

- **Steps & Instructions:**
    - Clone the CarbonAssistant Function repository.
    - Create an issue about this task in the gitlab repo.
    - Plan how you intend to get started with the task, discuss with the mentors about your approach and any doubts you have.
    - Try to deploy the function and the agent unmodified by creating your own Google 'Actions on Google' project. Use the deployment guide in the repository README for this.
    - Verify everything is fine and working. This will be your own test environment. If you have any trouble creating a project or deploying, reach out to the mentors.
Once everything is set and working, document your approach for the task and get it reviewed.
    - Start with your task and create PR(s) as necessary.
    - Connect with your mentors in time if you see a potential roadblock.

- **Outcome:**
  - A working implementation where we can ask the Action in conversational English about how much emissions a particular agricultural process produces in some country.
