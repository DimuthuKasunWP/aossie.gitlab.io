
## Agora

### Idea: Front-End & REST API

#### Description

Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. Last year, we have built Agora-web, a website to conduct online elections. This year, we have planned to extend the functionalities of the Agora-web. This project has two subprojects.

- Agora-web currently has a very minimalistic frontend design. We hope to make Agora-Web more user-friendly and interactive. Also, we would like to decouple the front end completely from the backend.

- Convert Agora-Web backend into a RESTful API based service.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- Experienced in frontend development and frameworks (Angular, React)

- Ability to design user friendly and interactive interfaces.

- Basic understating of Client-Server architecture model and REST API concepts.

- Experienced in Scala (or with solid programming skills in other object-oriented and functional programming languages and willing to learn Scala).

- Preferably with knowledge of the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com) for web development in Scala.

- Basic knowledge of Swagger (OpenAPI Specification).

- Knowledge of RESTful web services.

- Preferably with previous experience setting up web apps in cloud platforms like Heroku, Google App Engine or [others](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cheap-alternatives-to-Heroku-that-are-always-on).

You don't have to be an expert in all these skills. Some previous experience in related skills and a lot of motivation to learn quickly would suffice.
