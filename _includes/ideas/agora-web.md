### Idea: Web Front-End for Agora

#### Description

Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. So far, Agora has been available only as a library, to be included and used within other Scala or Java programs, or as a stand-alone command-line program. 

This project idea aims to make Agora available to the wider public, by creating a web front-end that will allow users to set up online elections.

Other online voting systems (e.g. [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/)) are typically neither open-source nor free. We believe that implementations of vote-counting algorithms must be open-source, so that they can be scrutinized. We want to provide free software foundations for our democracies.

We seek a user interface combining features of [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/) and [Doodle](http://doodle.com). We would like it to be at least as easy to set up an online election as it is easy to schedule an event in Doodle.




#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- experienced in Scala (or with solid programming skills in other object-oriented and functional programming languages and willing to learn Scala).

- preferably with knowledge of the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com) for web development in Scala.

- with knowledge of databases, to store elections persistently.

- preferably with previous experience setting up web apps in cloud platforms like Heroku, Google App Engine or [others](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cheap-alternatives-to-Heroku-that-are-always-on).

- with ability to produce a simple HTML/CSS interface using a minimalistic framework (e.g. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [others](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bootstrap-alternatives/)).


You don't have to be an expert in all these skills. Some previous experience in related skills and a lot of motivation to learn quickly would suffice.
