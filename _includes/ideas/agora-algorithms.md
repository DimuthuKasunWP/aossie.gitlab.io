### Idea: More Vote-Counting Algorithms

#### Description

Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. So far it has focused mostly on variants of the [STV algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) used in Australia. 

This project idea aims to expand Agora's collection of algorithms. We would like Agora to provide at least all algorithms listed in the leftmost collumn of [this wikipedia table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#Compliance_of_selected_systems_.28table.29).

Vote-counting methods are often not described in an algorithmically precise way. Therefore, one of the challenges of this project is to be able to comprehend natural language specifications of vote-counting methods and produce a clear implementation that does what the specification wants.


#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- experienced in Scala (or with solid programming skills in other object-oriented and functional programming languages and willing to learn Scala).

- with good text comprehension skills (to understand imprecise specifications of vote counting methods (e.g. in wikipedia))
