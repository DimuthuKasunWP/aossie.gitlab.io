### Idea: REST API for Agora-web

#### Description

Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. For last year GSoC, we have built the Agora-web, A website to contact online elections. We planned to extends its functionalities as a RESTful web service. This project idea aims to convert Agora web into a RESTful API based service. Furthermore, we are planning to introduce some new features to Agora-web.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- Experienced in Scala (or with solid programming skills in other object-oriented and functional programming languages and willing to learn Scala).

- Preferably with knowledge of the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com) for web development in Scala.

- Basic knowledge in Swagger (OpenAPI Specification).

- Knowledge in RESTful web services.

- Preferably with previous experience setting up web apps in cloud platforms like Heroku, Google App Engine or [others](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cheap-alternatives-to-Heroku-that-are-always-on).


You don't have to be an expert in all these skills. Some previous experience in related skills and a lot of motivation to learn quickly would suffice.
