### Idea: Proof Search Improvements

#### Description

Scavenger is a new theorem prover (implemented in 2016) based on the [Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04568v1.pdf) calculus, which generalizes conflict-driven clause learning ([CDCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-Driven_Clause_Learning)) to first-order logic. 

Although it currently has a proof searcdh strategy that is believed to be complete, it is clear that there still many things that could be improved:

1. we could use indexing techniques to reduce the number of unification attempts.
2. we should not reset the set of decision literals after every conflict. Instead, we should try to back-track non-chronologically, as SAT-solvers do.
3. to circumvent the problem that, in contrast to the propositional case, unit-propagation does not always terminate in the first-order case, we currently interleave decisions and propagations, iteratively deepening the length of propagations. We could try other approaches as well. We could, for instance, iteratively deepen the depth of terms allowed in propagations.
4. there are fragments of first-order logic (such as the effectively propositional Bernays-Sch√∂nfinkel fragment) for which first-order unit-propagation always terminates. We could investigate specialized proof search strategies for this easier fragment.



#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- experience in Scala (or with solid programming skills in other object-oriented and functional programming languages and willing to learn Scala).

- firm knowledge of logic (especially first-order logic and unification)

- willingness to do performance regression tests (with Scalameter) and experiments to evaluate how helpful the proof search improvements are.

- technical creativity to fill the gaps and formulate the idea described above in a mathematically precise way.
