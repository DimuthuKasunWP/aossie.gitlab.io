## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: CO2 Emissions for Flights

#### Description

Carbon Footprint is currently a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox and Safari) that calculates and displays the CO2 emissions incurred when driving (or using public transportation) on routes suggested by map services such as Google Maps, Here and Open Street Map.

We would like to expand the scope of the Carbon Footprint project by calculating and displaying the CO2 emissions of flights when the user searches for flights in websites such as [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com) and [others](http://alternativeto.net/software/hipmunk/) (inlcuding the websites of major airlines).

Carbon Footprint already has a very modular code architecture, which allows code to be reused for different websites (e.g. Google Maps, Here, Open Street Map). Including more websites (e.g. Hipmunk and others) should be easy. But now we would be calculating CO2 footprint for something else, and this would require some generalization of the modular architecture. If you decide to apply to this idea, please demonstrate that you have a good understanding of the architecture and sketch how you would generalize it.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- good knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS.

- ability to extract relevant information (e.g. flight distance, flight time, airplane type) from various websites.

- good software engineering skills, to maximize code reuse and produce modular code.
