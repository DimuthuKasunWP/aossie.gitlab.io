## Mind The Word

### Idea: Mobile App

#### Description

Mind The Word (MTW) is a browser extension that helps users to learn vocabulary of new languages. When visiting a webpage written in the user's native language, MTW will randomly translate a specified percentage of words into the language that the user wants to learn. By seeing the new words in context, the user will be able to infer and memorize their meanings.

Since nowadays people often browse websites using their mobiles, we would like to make MTW available for mobiles as well, if this is feasible in a way that would be easily usable. There is an [ongoing discussion](https://github.com/OiWorld/MindTheWord/issues/53) about how this could be achievable. [Another thread](https://github.com/OiWorld/CarbonFootprint/issues/135) in a different project also contains some ideas that could be helpful. 

A proposal to work on this idea should present an approach to port MTW to mobiles and show convincing evidence that it is feasible.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS.

- experience implementing mobile apps


#### Mentors

Rohan Katyal, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo
