### Idea: Reviving the famous Google Sky Maps

#### Description

The Google [Sky Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid) app was open-sourced back in 2012. It is an amazing project but it looks like the original developers don't have time to maintain this app actively anymore. Our aim is to bring this project back to life this year with the help of GSoC 2018 and of course, with the help of some hard working students endowed with it. You can check out the current GitHub repo of this project over [here](https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid).

When asked for future plans, the app's lead maintainer once told me:
>>_I have lots of plans: revamping the look and feel, of course, adding in more celestial objects and more features (and yet somehow doing so in a way that keeps this a really small app - I think that’s one of its strengths). I’d like to do crazy things like a VR mode. So...I have lots of things I want to do, and some kind folks have volunteered to help. Unfortunately I’ve been in one of my periodic Sky Map slumps for a few months where the Day Job has left little time for it._

We can start by addressing the piled up issue tracker on GitHub. But since this project is new to our organization, we are open to suggestions! You are welcome to come up with your own creative ideas about how can the project's current state be transformed into something more modular so that it can compete with others in the market.  

We'll be starting Gitter/IRC soon to discuss prospects over there.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- with knowledge and experience of building Mobile apps on Android and/or other platforms, react-native (if we decide to build this project from scratch on this to support iOS and Android), any other cross-platform framework.

- with slight astronomical temperament that could be beneficial to understand the app's working and invoke interest to implement new features or better yet, improve existing ones.

- some experience of working with mobile sensors such as accelerometers, compass and gyroscopes is an asset but not essential.
