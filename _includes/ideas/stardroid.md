### Idea: Building Google Sky Maps from scratch on a Cross-Platform framework

#### Description

The Google [Sky Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid) app was open-sourced back in 2012. It is an amazing project but it looks like the original developers don't have time to maintain this app actively anymore.

When asked for future plans, the app's lead maintainer once told me:
>>_I have lots of plans: revamping the look and feel, of course, adding in more celestial objects and more features (and yet somehow doing so in a way that keeps this a really small app - I think that’s one of its strengths). I’d like to do crazy things like a VR mode. So...I have lots of things I want to do, and some kind folks have volunteered to help. Unfortunately, I’ve been in one of my periodic Sky Map slumps for a few months where the Day Job has left little time for it._

There is also a demand for an iOS version of this app. So this is a good time to consider cross-platform frameworks such as React-Native. You are welcome to come up with your own creative ideas about how can the project be transformed into something more modular so that it can compete with others in the market. Since no original maintainer of this project would be available to mentor, we would love to have someone who likes working independently.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student who has:

- knowledge and experience of building Mobile apps on native Android and iOS and/or cross-platform frameworks such as react-native.

- some astronomical and engineering temperament could be beneficial to understand the app's working and invoke enough interest to implement new features or better yet, improve existing ones.

- some experience of working with mobile sensors (accelerometers, compass and gyroscopes) and rendering views on OpenGL ES. Having these skills is an asset but not essential.
