## CrowdAlert

### Idea: Mobile App

#### Description

CrowdAlert is a cross platform mobile application that allows users to post and view incidents around them.

In 2017, we had a GSoC student who worked on this mobile application. Check [this](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CrowdAlert/blob/master/doc/GSOC/2017/siddartha.md) to know about Goals achieved by him, Challenges and Future scope.

This mobile app still needs further improvements and new features. There is an [ongoing repository](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CrowdAlert) which holds the code and issues on how to achieve this goal. Please consider the challenges and possible solutions discussed there when preparing your proposal. 

In repository, some issues are labeled as GSoC-Tasks. Try to solve those issues and showcase your skills to us.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of React Native.

- experience of building mobile apps using Expo.

- hands-on experience in testing using Jest.


#### Mentors

Anuj Gupta, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, Siddartha Sekhar Padhi
