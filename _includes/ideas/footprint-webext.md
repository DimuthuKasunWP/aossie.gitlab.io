## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Using WebExtensions

#### Description

Since we started building this extension the team at mozilla has come up with a new extension platform called WebExtensions wich basically mirrors Google's extension format but with a few subtile differences in the implementation.

We would like to make the switch to WebExtensions because it should allow us to decrease clutter and size of the codebase considerably.

Note that this will most likely not be enough work to keep you busy for the whole program so you should propose additional project ideas if you want to work on this one.

There is an [ongoing discussion](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/issues/138) in our issues list on how to achieve this goal.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- basic knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS.

#### Mentors

Chirag Arora, Kolya Opahle, Prateek Gupta, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo
