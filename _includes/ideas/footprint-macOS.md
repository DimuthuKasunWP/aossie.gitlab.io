### Idea: Migrating Safari port to Safari App Extension

#### Description

Apple has come up with a new platform called Safari App Extension. It's a native macOS app that can work as an extension to Safari and could also interact with the macOS itself. The benefit of this would be that we could list our app directly on the macOS app store instead of the Safari Extension Gallery. A native app opens a world of new possibilities. For example, a 'menu bar preference pane' can be added and we can also utilize the native notification system.

Since, we already have a working version of the extension made using 'Extension Builder' inside Safari, it shouldn't be hard to migrate to a Safari App Extension.

The official guide to build a Safari App Extension can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/SafariAppExtension_PG/)

Note that this will most likely not be enough work to keep you busy for the whole program so you should propose additional project ideas if you want to work on this one.
