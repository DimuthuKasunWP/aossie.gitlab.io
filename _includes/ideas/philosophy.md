## Computational Philosophy

### Idea: Library for Philosophical Logic

#### Description

Interactive theorem provers have been used with some success in mathematics – most famously in the formalization of Thomas Hales’ proof of the Kepler conjecture. More recently, similar techniques have been employed in philosophy – most famously in the formalization of Kurt Gödel’s ontological argument by Christoph Benzmüller and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo.

In mathematics, interactive theorem provers are supported by large libraries of basic lemmas and theorems. A systematic approach to computational philosophy requires similar resources. This is all the more so since much logic used for philosophy is non-classical. Formalizing Gödel’s ontological argument, for example, required modal logic to be added first.

So the idea behind this project would be to equip the Isabelle proof assistant with some basic philosophical logic, which could be used over and over in applications to various arguments. Some possibilities, in rough order of difficulty, are:
1.	Mereology – the axiomatic theory of the part/whole relation
2.	Mereotopology – the extension of mereology to boundaries and connections
3.	Counterfactual conditionals – building on existing work in modal logic
4.	Tense logic – also building on existing work in modal logic
5.	Tensed Mereology – theories combining (1) and (4)
These are suggestions – ideas to work on other areas of logic closely related to metaphysics are very welcome.

If you are interested in this project idea, please choose a (possibly improper) subset of the possibilities above and provide a realistic timeline in your proposal. Depending on how many slots we receive from Google, we might be able to accept more than one student, to work on disjoint subsets.

We recommend reading our [papers and talk slides](https://gitlab.com/aossie/ComputationalPhilosophy/tree/master) and having a look on the files and lecture notes of the [Computational Metaphysics course](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/users/lex/lehre/compmeta/).


#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of logic (especially higher-order logic and the Isabelle proof assistant)

- a deep interest in philosophy



#### Mentors

Ben Blumson, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo
