## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Mobile App

#### Description

Carbon Footprint is currently a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox and Safari) that calculates and displays the CO2 emissions incurred when driving (or using public transportation) on routes suggested by map services such as Google Maps, Here and Open Street Map. Initially, it was an extension for Google Chrome only and it worked only on Google Maps. 

In 2016, we had GSoC students who, among various other achievements, ported the extension to Firefox and Safari and expanded its scope to other map services. This year we would like to expand this even further and make Carbon Footprint work as a mobile app.

There is an [ongoing discussion](https://github.com/OiWorld/CarbonFootprint/issues/135) in our issues list about how to achieve this technically challenging goal. Please consider the challenges and possible solutions discussed there when preparing your proposal.


#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS.

- experience implementing mobile apps


#### Mentors

Chirag Arora, Kolya Opahle, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo
