## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Mobile App

#### Description

Carbon Footprint is currently a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox and Safari) that calculates and displays the CO2 emissions incurred when driving (or using public transportation) on routes suggested by map services such as Google Maps, Here and Open Street Map. 

In 2017, we had GSoC Students who, among various other achievements, expanded it even further to make Carbon Footprint work as a mobile app to calculate Real Time CO2 emissions incurred for both Android and iOS using React Native. The mobile app is still far from done and we need additional features and a little polishing to finally release it.

There is an [ongoing repository](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint-Mobile/) which holds the code and issues on how to achieve this goal. Please consider the challenges and possible solutions discussed there when preparing your proposal. 
In repository, some issues are labeled as GSoC-Tasks. Try to solve those issues and showcase your skills to us. 


#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of React Native.

- experience implementing mobile apps.


#### Mentors
