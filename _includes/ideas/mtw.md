## Mind The Word

### Idea: Making Mind the Word robust, user-friendly and production-ready

#### Description

Mind The Word (MTW) is a browser extension that helps users to learn vocabulary of new languages. When visiting a webpage written in the user's native language, MTW will randomly translate a specified percentage of words into the language that the user wants to learn. By seeing the new words in context, the user is able to infer and memorize their meanings.

MTW was originally implemented around 2011, being the first extension of its kind.
Nowadays, MTW is suffering competition from comercial alternatives, and we need help to keep MTW competitive. MTW needs more user-firendly interface, simplified options, easy-to-follow onboarding, translations without needing API keys, robustness (making sure that MTW is working consistently on all webpages) and efficiency (speeding-up the translation and the replacement of words by translated words). In a nutshell, we need to transform MTW into a production-ready professional-looking extension.
