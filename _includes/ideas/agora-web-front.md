
## Agora

### Idea: Front-End for Agora-web

#### Description

Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. For last year GSoC, we have built the Agora-web, A website to contact online elections. This project idea aims to make Agora-Web more user friendly and decouple the front end completely from the backend.

We seek a user interface combining features of [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/) and [Doodle](http://doodle.com). We would like it to be at least as easy to set up an online election as it is easy to schedule an event in Doodle.


#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student:

- Experienced in any front end frameworks( Angular, React)

- Preferably with previous experience setting up web apps in cloud platforms like Heroku, Google App Engine or [others](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cheap-alternatives-to-Heroku-that-are-always-on).

- Ability to design user friendly interfaces.

- Basic understating of Client - Server architecture model and REST API concepts.

You don't have to be an expert in all these skills. Some previous experience in related skills and a lot of motivation to learn quickly would suffice.
