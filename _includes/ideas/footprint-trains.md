## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Trains Emission Calculation and Better Error Detection

#### Description

Last year  we added an error detection system for this project, however it can be improved further. Ideally it should be able to tell whether the error causes the extension to entirely stop working on a particular website or not and based on this information the particular website should be disabled using the enable/disable module built in.


Also, currently the extension has limited support for calculation of carbon emission from trains. Calculation of carbon emission of trains is significantly different when compared to aircrafts and cars. The extension currently only supports France’s train system and expansion of its features should probably be done country wise. In your proposal clearly explain your approach and give links to relevant documents.

This project won’t take too long therefore should be combined with other project ideas, feel free to come up with your own ideas.

**Note - You are supposed to propose the datasets in your GSoC proposal**

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- motivation to search, find and understand sources of reliable scientific data about CO2 emissions.

- knowledge of OOP, Javascript, HTML/CSS and possibly some Machine Learning.


#### Mentors

Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, Chirag Arora, Kolya Opahle, Prateek Gupta, Vaibhav Sharma, Nakul Havelia.
